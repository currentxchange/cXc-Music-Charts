# Where am I?

You're on the internet, silly. 

# What's here?

Just about everything. Oh, you mean HERE here. Here you will find daily charts from [cXc Music](https://music.cxc.world)

# About Daily Charts

 Charts are generated just after midnight GMT every single day.
 
 Charts are always lagging one day from present, as we only store the results after the time period has completed.
 
> You can, however, go onto [cXc Music](https://music.cxc.world), click the clock icon, twist some knobs, and see charts for this day thus far.
 
 Only Upvotes from the relevant day are included in this directory, from 00:00 GMT to 23:59 GMT.
 
# Format
 
 Charts will be posted in JSON format and Markdown format. Markdown data includes embeddible information that can be used with third party apps like Steemit.com and Hive.blog. We may also generate a pure markdown version in the future.
